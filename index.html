        <h2>Why The Navel?</h2>
        <p>
          Synthetic beef companies have increased in notoriety as people search for healthier, more
          sustainable protein alternatives.<br>Improbable Beef is new to this space and is interested in
          studying bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste<br>like beef.
          Other labs have found success in imitating meat with algae, fungi, and microorganisms
          found on plant roots.<br>However, there are many bacterial species that do not receive much
          scientific attention, and it is possible that one of them<br>makes an even tastier beef
          alternative. One place that imitation protein companies have failed to investigate thus far
          is the<br>belly button. Individuals across the country were sampled to identify the species
          that colonize their navels. This dashboard<br>allows the research participants as well as the
          scientists to view the bacterial species that were found in each<br>anonymous sample by selecting
          an ID number.
