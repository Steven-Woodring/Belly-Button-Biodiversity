# Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly
### Analysis and visualization of the bacteria found in belly buttons

## Summary
Synthetic beef companies have increased in notoriety as people search for healthier, more
sustainable protein alternatives.<br>Improbable Beef is new to this space and is interested in
studying bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste<br>like beef.
Other labs have found success in imitating meat with algae, fungi, and microorganisms
found on plant roots.<br>However, there are many bacterial species that do not receive much
scientific attention, and it is possible that one of them<br>makes an even tastier beef
alternative. One place that imitation protein companies have failed to investigate thus far
is the<br>belly button. Individuals across the country were sampled to identify the species
that colonize their navels. This dashboard<br>allows the research participants as well as the
scientists to view the bacterial species that were found in each<br>anonymous sample by selecting
an ID number.
