# Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly
### Analysis and visualization of the bacteria found in belly buttons

## Summary
Synthetic beef companies have increased in notoriety as people search for healthier, more
sustainable protein alternatives. Improbable Beef is new to this space and is interested in
studying bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
Other labs have found success in imitating meat with algae, fungi, and microorganisms
found on plant roots. However, there are many bacterial species that do not receive much
scientific attention, and it is possible that one of them makes an even tastier beef
alternative. One place that imitation protein companies have failed to investigate thus far
is the belly button. Individuals across the country were sampled to identify the species
that colonize their navels. This dashboard allows the research participants as well as the
scientists to view the bacterial species that were found in each anonymous sample by selecting
an ID number.
